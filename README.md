This app allows users to share real-time location updates during a trip, whether traveling by car or any other mode of transportation that allows location tracking and internet connectivity, enabling others to follow their progress of 
their journey in real time.  
Designed for both Trip Leaders and Trip Followers, the app lets Trip Leaders share their real-time progress, while Trip Followers can track the Trip Leader’s movements throughout the journey, providing an interactive way to stay 
engaged with the trip’s progression. 
Each trip is identified by a unique trip ID, which the Trip Leader can share with anyone who wishes to follow the journey. 
Trip Followers can then use this ID to track the Trip Leader’s real-time location updates. 
Trip Leaders and Trip Followers can view the progress of the trip on a map within the app. They can zoom, pan, or center the map on the Trip Leader’s current location to track their journey in real time. 
In addition to the map, the app displays key trip details, including the total distance traveled, elapsed trip time, and the trip start time, providing users with comprehensive information about the journey.
